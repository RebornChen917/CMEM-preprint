## Abstract
Interface Statement

This work presents a methodological framework for analyzing irreversibility, return-path exhaustion, and interface stability across complex systems.

It does not propose empirical predictions, simulations, or testable physical models.
It is not a metaphysical doctrine, cultural narrative, or historical reinterpretation.

The framework is designed to clarify why systems that appear cyclic, complete, or symbolically closed may nevertheless terminate irreversibly once return capacity is structurally consumed.

All concepts herein should be read as interface operators rather than ontological claims.
They describe constraints on action, reversibility, and decision space—not truths about nature, destiny, or history.

This work is intended to be used as a diagnostic lens for system design, governance, and long-horizon decision-making, not as an explanatory theory of the world.

Readers seeking prediction, validation, or narrative coherence may find this framework intentionally unsatisfying.

Its purpose is not to answer questions, but to prevent the wrong ones from being asked.

---

### Author’s Structural Position

The framework presented here implies that
what is often described as “reincarnation”
is a misinterpretation of system cyclicity.

Cycles are conditional.
Return paths can be depleted.
No recurrence is guaranteed by form alone.

Author’s Note

I did not write these documents to explain the world,
nor to correct existing theories, propose alternatives, or compete for coherence.

These texts exist because, in many domains,
explanation continues long after the interface has already failed.

CMEM and its associated notes are not theories, models, or predictive systems.
They are diagnostic records—written at the moment where interpretation should stop,
but usually does not.

I am not interested in answering “why” questions once structural admissibility has been lost.
I am interested in identifying where systems cease to be interpretable,
where optimization becomes noise,
and where continuity is falsely assumed.

Many of the expressions, symbols, and constructions used across these papers
are intentionally non-operational.
They are not unfinished formulas.
They are finished boundaries.

If a reader finds themselves trying to compute, extend, refute, or apply them,
then the boundary has already been crossed—and the document has done its job.

These writings do not ask to be believed.
They ask only to be placed correctly.

I make no claim that these documents are necessary.
Only that they are precise.

If they are useful, it is because a similar interface failure has already been encountered.
If they are not, they may be safely ignored.

Nothing here instructs action.
Nothing here predicts outcomes.
Nothing here promises understanding.

They simply record where understanding ends.

Citation & Use Notice

(Mandatory Reading for Any Citation or Reference)

Scope of Use

All documents within the CMEM framework are structural diagnostic records,
not explanatory theories, predictive models, or optimization proposals.

They define interface structure, stability criteria, and freeze-order behavior only.

⸻

Citation Conditions

By citing, referencing, or building upon any CMEM-related document, the citer implicitly acknowledges that:
	1.	CMEM does not provide causal narratives or purpose-driven explanations.
	2.	Any cited concept must be used in its original structural and non-teleological context.
	3.	Extracting formulas, symbols, or terminology without the associated structural scope is considered misuse.
	4.	CMEM diagnostics do not imply intervention authority, policy guidance, or design endorsement.

⸻

Prohibited Interpretations

The following uses are explicitly out of scope and unsupported:
	•	Treating CMEM as a unifying physical theory
	•	Interpreting CMEM symbols as predictive equations
	•	Using CMEM language to justify optimization, acceleration, or governance actions
	•	Framing CMEM diagnostics as moral, political, or metaphysical claims

⸻

Responsibility Statement

Any interpretation, application, or extension beyond diagnostic description
is the sole responsibility of the user and does not represent the CMEM framework.

⸻

Final Clause

CMEM documents describe what stabilizes, what freezes, and what collapses.
They do not explain why, and they do not instruct what should be done.

If your use requires answers to “why” or “what should be done”,
these documents are not addressed to you.

CMEM Structural Role Annotation — Boundary Patch

Temporal Boundary Patch (TBP)

(Placement: between Level 0 and Level 1)

⸻

Official Insert

Temporal Boundary Patch — System Boundary Definition

This patch introduces Temporal Exponent Sets as a boundary condition within the CMEM framework.

Coherent systems are defined not by spatial scale, material composition, or continuity assumptions,
but by discrete temporal tolerance thresholds expressed as exponent sets (e.g.,  Δt^3^-27, Δt^3^27).

System transitions occur only at exponent-boundary crossings.
Intermediate states are not treated as partially coherent systems.

This patch bridges:
	•	Level 0 (Stability Criterion) — what stability means, and
	•	Level 1 (Runtime & Release Dynamics) — how instability unfolds in time.

It provides a non-continuous boundary rule for determining when a system is inside, outside, or no longer a system.
