## Abstract
[Interface Statement

This work presents a methodological framework for analyzing irreversibility, return-path exhaustion, and interface stability across complex systems.

It does not propose empirical predictions, simulations, or testable physical models.
It is not a metaphysical doctrine, cultural narrative, or historical reinterpretation.

The framework is designed to clarify why systems that appear cyclic, complete, or symbolically closed may nevertheless terminate irreversibly once return capacity is structurally consumed.

All concepts herein should be read as interface operators rather than ontological claims.
They describe constraints on action, reversibility, and decision space—not truths about nature, destiny, or history.

This work is intended to be used as a diagnostic lens for system design, governance, and long-horizon decision-making, not as an explanatory theory of the world.

Readers seeking prediction, validation, or narrative coherence may find this framework intentionally unsatisfying.

Its purpose is not to answer questions, but to prevent the wrong ones from being asked.]
