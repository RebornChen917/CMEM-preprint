## Abstract
Interface Statement

This work presents a methodological framework for analyzing irreversibility, return-path exhaustion, and interface stability across complex systems.

It does not propose empirical predictions, simulations, or testable physical models.
It is not a metaphysical doctrine, cultural narrative, or historical reinterpretation.

The framework is designed to clarify why systems that appear cyclic, complete, or symbolically closed may nevertheless terminate irreversibly once return capacity is structurally consumed.

All concepts herein should be read as interface operators rather than ontological claims.
They describe constraints on action, reversibility, and decision space—not truths about nature, destiny, or history.

This work is intended to be used as a diagnostic lens for system design, governance, and long-horizon decision-making, not as an explanatory theory of the world.

Readers seeking prediction, validation, or narrative coherence may find this framework intentionally unsatisfying.

Its purpose is not to answer questions, but to prevent the wrong ones from being asked.

---

### Author’s Structural Position

The framework presented here implies that
what is often described as “reincarnation”
is a misinterpretation of system cyclicity.

Cycles are conditional.
Return paths can be depleted.
No recurrence is guaranteed by form alone.

Citation & Use Notice

(Mandatory Reading for Any Citation or Reference)

Scope of Use

All documents within the CMEM framework are structural diagnostic records,
not explanatory theories, predictive models, or optimization proposals.

They define interface structure, stability criteria, and freeze-order behavior only.

⸻

Citation Conditions

By citing, referencing, or building upon any CMEM-related document, the citer implicitly acknowledges that:
	1.	CMEM does not provide causal narratives or purpose-driven explanations.
	2.	Any cited concept must be used in its original structural and non-teleological context.
	3.	Extracting formulas, symbols, or terminology without the associated structural scope is considered misuse.
	4.	CMEM diagnostics do not imply intervention authority, policy guidance, or design endorsement.

⸻

Prohibited Interpretations

The following uses are explicitly out of scope and unsupported:
	•	Treating CMEM as a unifying physical theory
	•	Interpreting CMEM symbols as predictive equations
	•	Using CMEM language to justify optimization, acceleration, or governance actions
	•	Framing CMEM diagnostics as moral, political, or metaphysical claims

⸻

Responsibility Statement

Any interpretation, application, or extension beyond diagnostic description
is the sole responsibility of the user and does not represent the CMEM framework.

⸻

Final Clause

CMEM documents describe what stabilizes, what freezes, and what collapses.
They do not explain why, and they do not instruct what should be done.

If your use requires answers to “why” or “what should be done”,
these documents are not addressed to you.
